# New ARDEK wp theme
This new ARKDE theme is only based on Learndash and not using any other theme as background.

New UI based on following figma design made by me: https://www.figma.com/file/YiL5NIS4uCGzgQzYfevNs7/ARKDE-LMS-2.0

## New development guidelines
- No use of Jquery at all
- ES6 compatible Javascript
- Modular components with JS classes
- Use more of css variables than sass variables to edit styles on the fly with JS if needed

All this has resulted on a more robust codebase for the future of ARKDE!

### This project is still in development
